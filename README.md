# FRAS
The Facial Recognition Attendance System (FRAS)is designed to automate the attendance tracking process using facial recognition technology. This system utilizes a webcam to capture live video feed, detects faces, and recognizes registered faces while ensuring liveness detection by monitoring eye blinks.  

Project Overview:
The system comprises several components including a user interface for registration and recognition, face registration functionality, liveness detection, and attendance marking. The primary goal is to provide a reliable, automated, and user-friendly attendance system.

Libraries and Dependencies The project utilizes several libraries:

1. OpenCV: For image and video processing.
2. face_recognition: For facial recognition operations.
3. dlib: For facial landmark detection.
4. Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
5. scipy: For calculating distances in liveness detection.
6. imutils: For convenient handling of image processing functions.
